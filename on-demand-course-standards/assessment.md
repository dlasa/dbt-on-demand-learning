# Assessment

## Assessment requirements

**Requirement**. Courses must include ongoing and frequent assessment, and the relationship between learning outcomes and assessment must be clear.

**Guidelines.** Include two or more answer options for multiple choice questions, make sure you use a consistent number of answer options that do not include clues as to which answer is correct. Use plausible detractors, provide immediate feedback, and use rejoinders. Do not ask questions about topics not covered in the course material.

**Examples.** Refer to the [**dbt Fundamentals Quiz**](https://learn.getdbt.com/learn/course/dbt-fundamentals-quiz/dbt-fundamentals-badge/dbt-fundamentals-badge?page=1) course for an example of a well-formatted quiz. Note: this quiz includes all of the knowledge checks from dbt Fundamentals in one assessment.
